# Design-of-Miller-OTA-Using-gm-Id-Method-

The goal of the project is to design a Band pass Filter for Neurological Acquisition System
which shall be capable to record two different types of neurological signals:

➢ Local Field Potentials (LFP).

➢ Action potential (Spikes).

The following requirements were given:

- Supply voltage Vdd = 3.3V
- Gain =40dB = 100
- Cut-off frequencies – 1Hz High Pass and 10kHz Low Pass to accommodate for LFPs
and Neural Potentials
- 350nm PDK for the MOFETs
-Area constraint 0.225sq mm
-Input noise of 50nV\Hz^0.5
-Power dissipation of each transistor 180 μW
